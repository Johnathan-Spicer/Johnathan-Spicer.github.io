        <h1>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h1>
        <p>The first thing I learned was to ask for help. For years now, I have been taught to get used to being independent and thinking that asking for help is a sign of weakness. <br>
           The second thing was learning that I wasn’t actually as good at coding as I originally thought. <br>
            When I worked on the first sprint I thought that this was going to be easy, and that I was going to nail it. But overtime, I realized that I had my faults in programming, and it’s okay to be bad in some areas. <br> 
            My third and final problem I learned about myself was that I’m a workaholic. I had suspected I was one over the years, but Dev Academy helped me confirm it. <br>
             I don’t stop working until I burn myself out entirely. Overall, Dev Academy has helped me learn a lot of things in a very short amount of time as a whole.
        </p>
        <h1>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h1>
        <p>For values you need them to have a good learning experience, without values you wouldn’t be able to learn without them since everyone learns differently, and everyone has different values that enable them to learn. <br>
           For Empathy, you must be kind to others, and help one another. Otherwise no one will want to be around you, and when you inevitably need help, no one will be there to help you. <br>
            The most important one is self-awareness. Coding forces you to be self aware, it makes you face your faults head on. <br> 
            If you’re not able to confront yourself often, then you’re going to have a hard time coding.
        </p>
        <h1>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h1>
        <p>I would say everything to do with core was very surprising. I thought we would head into coding straight away, but the fact that this course makes you confront yourself, and makes you see yourself for who you really are is a good thing.
        </p>
        <h1>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h1>
        <p>Probably the stuff to do with finding positives within myself. I’m filled with a lot of self hatred, so just trying to name anything positive about myself is a real challenge. <br>
           I eventually managed to do it with the help of some of my friends, but it wasn’t easy.
        </p>
        <h1>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h1>
        <p>To help ground yourself more for when you eventually get a job. <br>
           The difference between Dev Academy and a university is that one teaches you the work, <br>
            and the other teaches you the work but also makes sure you have different tools to help control your emotions better in a work environment. Basically, in short, it’s to help you become a better employee.
        </p>
        <h1>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h1>
        <p>No, I think the core stuff is necessary. If you have issues learning, emotional issues, and more then that definitely should be explored and learned to be controlled properly when you eventually get a job.
