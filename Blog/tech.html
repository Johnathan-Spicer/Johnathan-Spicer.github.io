      <h1>BORDERS!</h1>
      <p>For this example, I have chosen a very thicc Garfield. Thicc Garfield will be used to teach the principle of borders, padding, and margins. So without further ado, let's begin! <br>
    Borders are properties that allow you to create barriers around specfic DIV's you've created. Once you've created the border, you can program it to have different sizes, colours, and more! In this case, the border is around Garfield to show that he's not wanted in this area. <br>
  The border designed for Garfield has been programmed to be red, and the size has been programmed to fit specifically around Garfield's figure. </p></div>
  <div class="Margins">
    <img src="img/MarginGarfield.png" class="GarfieldMargin">
  </div>
  <div class="MarginText">
    <h1>MARGINS!</h1>
    <p>A margin is the space around a border. Think of it this way, the margin is the thing that controls area that is outside of the border. <br>
       In this example, the margin designed for Garfield's poster is the bit of paper that the border and padding fits into. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="Paddings">

  </div>
  <div class="PaddingText">
    <H1>PADDING!</H1>
    <p>The distance between a border and content is known as padding. Because margins and padding are so similar to one another, some of you could confuse the two terms. But don't worry, I'll explain the distinction between the two. <br>
      Padding regulates the area inside an element, whereas margins control a property on the outside of the element. Be warned, if you put too much padding and some of your precious elements will overflow. <br>
      (Kinda like Garfield if he eats too much lasagna, he turns into thicc Garfield) <br>
    <br> <br> And there you have it! You have learned everything there is to know about these elements and how they function! Give yourself a pat on the back, and cook up some nice fresh lasagna. Just don't let Garfield eat it (・ω・)</p>
