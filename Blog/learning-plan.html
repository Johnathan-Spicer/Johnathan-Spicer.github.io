      (1)I guess if I were to put it into words, it would be to try and be the best I possibly can be. I don’t expect to be the best in the world, or hell, even one of the best. I want to be a great programmer. I want to reflect back on myself 10 years from now and think that Dev Academy were humble beginnings that helped me become the programmer that I would be 10 years from now. I don’t want to be one of those people who are comfortable with what they know, and are fine in staying in the same position that they’re in because it’s more convenient. I want to keep learning, everyday I want to learn something new. I want to venture into uncharted territory that I know will make me uncomfortable in programming, and ultimately become the best version of myself I can possibly be. <br>


      (2)When it comes to learning, my biggest strengths can also be my biggest weaknesses at the same time. I never give up, and I always face every challenge and give it my one-hundred-and-ten percent. I’m a workaholic at heart, meaning that if I’m not constantly working or doing something each day I see as progress, I easily become unmotivated. This can be a problem, since sometimes I burn myself out by working so hard. If I want to get something done, I don’t rest until that thing is completely done. But sometimes I crash, which can take me out for a day or two. My weakness is that I need to learn how to take breaks, instead of overworking myself until I inevitably break down. <br>
      
      
     (3) I want to come out of my shell more so that I can meet new people and have new experiences. I never really liked interacting with people in school since I found it so intimidating. But Dev Academy gives me the chance to finally break out of that shell and enjoy experiences I could only have imagined to experience when I was in school. <br>
      
      
    (4)  I'll break up my daily workload into manageable parts and set deadlines for myself to meet so that I can finish all of my work-related obligations by the end of the week. I'll do whatever it takes to get back on track if I'm running late. Only I should be impacted by this; none of my cohorts or facilitators will be affected. But if things are getting to me, I generally take a relaxing walk outside. Due to my high functioning autism, you might notice that I get overwhelmed by noises around me. I have the necessary tools to deal with those issues, but if the circumstance happens in which the noise becomes intolerable for me, you might see me going outdoors for a few minutes to recover. In terms of burnout, If I have no other option and burnout is starting to get the better of me, I'll typically take breaks on the weekends. However, if I’m behind on a task I’ll be sure to communicate that with my group and facilitators. <br>
      
      
     (5) I’ve been getting pretty used to being independent for most of my life when working, so I often don’t ask for help because I either don’t need it or school’s have taught it as a sign of weakness. However, I’ve learned that if I am stuck on a problem for no more than half an hour, I will ask for help from a facilitator. <br>
      
      
     (6) I don’t expect all too much from the facilitators, they’ve all been great so far, and have met the needs I have. All I ask is that they continue being as helpful as they have been these last couple of weeks. The only thing I want them to understand is my disability. I have high-functioning autism, which comes with severe noise sensitivity. If it’s becoming too much to bear in bootcamp, and none of the things I mentioned above helped, I would request a quiet space for me to work in so I’m not affected. If all of these do not work, then I may enter into something called “paralysis”. Which is basically a breakdown from the noise becoming too much, you’ll definitely see and hear it happening, and when it occurs, I want you to call my parents to come pick me up. When I’m in paralysis, DO NOT try to speak to me, comfort me, or anything like that. This will only make my paralysis worse in the long run. The only way to stop my paralysis is if everything is completely silent, if you can’t make the room silent, then that is fine. My parents will pick me up, and take me away. <br>
          
                 Here are their phone numbers should you ever need them: <br>
                 Michelle: 027 525 2202   Dean: 021 582 531  It is preferable if you try and contact my                                                                                                                                                                                     
                 Father (Dean) first, since he will often be closer to Dev Academy than my mother is. <br>
      
                 If you have any other questions about my autism, I’d be happy to answer them either in a 
                 Call or in DMs. <br>
      
     (7) I’ve made sure to schedule all my activities on times where the activity and Dev Academy will not clash together. At the moment, there is nothing I can think of that will interfere with Dev Academy or my performance.
