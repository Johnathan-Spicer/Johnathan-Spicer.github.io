        <h1>A time you were stuck on a simple problem</h1>
        <p>I remember during the fourth sprint I was stuck on the Super FizzBuzz challenge. <br>
          After looking up any sort of method that could aid in my task, and after re-reading the problem multiple times and trying out different ways to complete it, I decided to watch Joseph’s live stream for some help. <br>
           Sure enough, he gave me all the help I needed to complete my work. I learned that instead of trying my hardest to fix something on my own, I should’ve reached out to my facilitators or my group for help. <br>
            I would’ve completed the work faster, and more time to focus on other parts of the tests. </p>
        <h1>A time when you elegantly solved a problem</h1>
        <p>When I was working on the builtin methods. Although, I am embarrassed to admit it took me a lot longer than I expected to get used to the => operator. <br>
           After a lot of googling, YouTube videos, and articles, I finally understood what it meant. After that minor hiccup, I felt like I was whizzing through everything with ease. <br> 
           It felt like as if I was playing the piano, and I was playing every key to perfection. It truly felt magical.</p>
           <h1>Pseudocode</h1>
           <p>I feel very confident in this technique. It makes everything a lot easier when the code is a lot simpler to read, and is broken down more effectively.</p>
           <h1>Trying Something</h1>
           <p> I do this method often, and I feel very confident in it. Since I get stuck on things often, this is usually my go to method when I’m trying to fix my situation.</p>
           <h1>Rubber Ducky Method</h1>
           <p>This one I’ve always done, even before starting this course. So I’ve always been quite comfortable with this method. (I never did it with a rubber ducky of course, unless it was in the bathtub :o )</p>
           <h1>Reading Error Messages</h1>
           <p> I do this frequently, just like the “trying something” method, this is one of my go to methods whenever I encounter a problem. </p>
           <h1>Console.Logging</h1>
           <p>I feel embarrassed to admit this, but I don’t do this method as much as I should be doing it. Half the time I’ll do it, and the other half I’ll just forget to. I am currently trying to make an effort to do this more often though. </p>
           <h1>Googling</h1>
           <p> I use this method so often that I might as well be the king of it. As soon as I don’t understand a method, I immediately head to Google to see what I’m not understanding, and see what I can learn to improve my code.</p>
           <h1>Asking Your Peers For Help</h1>
           <p>I barely do this because I feel like I would be a nuisance when I start to ask. I know that everyone here is willing to help each other in times of need, but I’m still trying to adjust to that kind of help.           </p>
           <h1>Asking Coaches For Help</h1>
           <p>this is similar to the last one, I’m still adjusting to this process, but am slowly asking for help more and more when I need it.          </p>
           <h1>Improving Your Process With Reflection</h1>
           <p>This has helped me a lot, self reflection has ultimately aided me in thinking back at what I did wrong and what I can do to improve. </p>
           <h1>Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help</h1>
           <p>Probably during the dots exercise a week or so back. The problem was so simple, and I was worried I would look like an idiot if I asked for help. But everyone was very kind and helpful, it made me more confident in asking for help when I needed it. </p>
