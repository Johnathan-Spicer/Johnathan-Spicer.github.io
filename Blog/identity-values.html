     (1) I had this dog named Charlie, and he was a little terror. He was my best friend, and while he was a troublemaker, that didn’t deter me from loving him any less. But one day, he got cancer. I had to make a decision, let him live until there was nothing else the vet could do, or put him down right there and save him the suffering. When you think about these moral dilemmas, it’s very easy to say “oh it’s obvious, I’d pick this option!” But when you’re actually in that situation, you freeze up. I weighed up the pros and cons, and I chose that he would be with me until the vets had done everything in their power. Deep down, I knew that it was unlikely to survive from a 5% chance, but I kept hoping he would. He died a few weeks later, and I was utterly crushed. To this day I still kind of miss him, every so often some memories I had of him would just come back to me, and they’d make me smile. Reflecting on the decision, I know as much as I want to say that I would’ve saved him from the pain, I still would’ve kept him alive for those last remaining few weeks just so I could have him in my arms again. <br>
      (2) Coming from a Christian household, growing up I was taught some good values, and some not so great ones… Being taught to be kind to others, to be loving and accepting were all valuable life lessons to have. But then there was the bad stuff, like rejecting people who are LGBTQ, and other sins that made no sense, like it being a sin to eat shrimp. I found this stuff in the Bible to be odd, and I eventually slowly strayed away from Christianity. And started making friends with all kinds of people, and listened to their point of view on everything. Overtime, I slowly became influenced by many people and their beliefs, until their beliefs ultimately turned into my own. There were also some other things that changed me into the person who I am today, like the media I watched, the music I listened to, and history that I would learn about from books. Overall, I can say that I am very proud of who I am today. <br>
      (3 )I have many strengths, my main one of course is working hard and not giving up until the task is complete. I like to think outside of the box when it comes to learning, and one of the most important things you’ll get from me is passion. I am passionate in everything that I do, and always love to give it my all at things I’m passionate about. These things can ultimately help me in becoming a better and more motivated worker in a work environment. I may not be the best, but I am the most determined to get shit done. <br>
      (4) My main one is not knowing when to quit or take a break. Once I’m working on something, I’m working on it until it’s either finished or the project finishes me. This flaw of mine won’t really affect my learning ability, since I’ve done this type of thing all my life where I work myself until I mentally and physically cannot any further. <br>
      (5) I’ve never had any issues with anyone while working with people, all of them have been great in the past. However, if conflict were to arise when working with someone in Dev Academy I would probably approach it by trying to see both sides to the problem and evaluate the most professional way to resolve it. I prefer to solve these conflicts between the people involved before involving a supervisor, but I also believe the supervisor can provide valuable insight and will readily ask for their help when I feel I can't resolve the situation adequately or unbiasedly myself. In situations involving my co-workers, but not myself, I try to stay uninvolved unless the problem is affecting productivity or professionalism.
