        <h1>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h1>
        <p>By understanding the principles of Neuroplasticity, we can teach others the benefits of Neuroplasticity <br>
           and give them a better environment to work in. 
        </p>
        <h1>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h2>
        <p>I would use the principles of neuroplasticity to my learning benefit. To further engage my mind, <br>
          and to use the tools I’ve learned for more efficient learning.
        </p>
        <h1>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
        <p>There are a couple ways to increase your neuroplasticity, the first one being to play video games. <br> The benefits associated with gaming include improvements in memory, reaction time, motor coordination, and cooperation. <br> Another one is by learning a new language. In one 2012 study, researchers examined 10 English-native exchange students who were studying German in Switzerland. <br> Their proficiency in German had improved after five months of intensive language training, and their gray matter density had as well. <br>This went on to improve one’s attention span, memory, and motor skills. So in short, just play lots of video games and learn some languages.

        <h1>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging. </h4>
        <p>A particular resource I found interesting was one by the National Library of Medicine. Explaining all the benefits of Neuroplasticity, and what Neuroplasticity is. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557811/#:~:text=It%20is%20defined%20as%20the,traumatic%20brain%20injury%20(TBI).">link</a></p>
        <h1>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h5>
        <p>If you have a growth mindset, you enjoy challenges and see failure as an opportunity to learn and advance your skills rather than as a way to define who you are. <br> Why this is so crucial in Dev Academy is due to the fact that the program can become unrelentingly brutal at points, and having a growth mindset is crucial for this kind of program.        </p>
        <h1>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h1>
        <p>A couple things did surprise me, the main one was figuring out that I have always had a growth mindset my whole life. <br> Striving to overcome any challenge in my way, and trying to be the very best I possibly can be.        </p>
        <h1>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h1>
        <p>I already have in lots of different ways in my study, so I don’t really need to plan that one out.</p>
        <h1>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h1>
        <p>This one site I read about growth mindsets on was very interesting. <br> The site explained perfectly what a growth mindset was, how I could use it, if it was beneficial to me, and why it even matters to have one in the first place. <a href="https://www.renaissance.com/edword/growth-mindset/#:~:text=Growth%20mindset%3A%20%E2%80%9CIn%20a%20growth,essential%20for%20great%20accomplishment.%E2%80%9D%20(
          ">link</a></p>
          <h1>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h1>
          <p>I think that learning about Neuroplasticity will help me greatly in the long run. <br> Everyone gets burnt out and sometimes procrastinate on doing the work, but I feel like Neuroplasticity will be a big game changer for me. <br> I think the advantages of neuroplasticity will also help me with planning out my goals in future, and help me decide what I’m going to do!
