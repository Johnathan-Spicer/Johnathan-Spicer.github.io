        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>My name is Johnathan. I was born in Wellington, and have lived here all my life. <br> 
        I've traveled to other places in my life, but none of them have felt as homely as Wellington. <br>
      This website will be mainly used for personal use, and to show my progress throughout my time in Dev Academy. <br>
    I hope you enjoy your stay; more updates are to come soon...</p>
